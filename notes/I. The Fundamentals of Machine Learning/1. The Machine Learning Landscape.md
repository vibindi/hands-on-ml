### Batch vs Online Learning
Batch (Offline) Learning: 
- Model must be trained using all available data
- Must retrain the data every so often due to *model rot*, where the model's performance decays over time (i.e., making predictions on financial market)
Online Learning:
- Train the system incrementally in mini batches
- System learns from new data on the fly even after the system is put into production
- Learning rate determines how fast it should adapt to changing data
### Instance-Based vs Model-Based Learning
Instance-Based Learning: 
- Memorize examples and predict based on them
Model-Based Learning:
- Build a model and predict using the model
